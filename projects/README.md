# Projects

Each folder here is a standalone ML project with its own README and assets.
We will build these incrementally so every step is clear and reproducible.

Planned projects (fintech‑aligned):
- `risk_scoring/` – credit risk or default prediction
- `fraud_detection/` – transaction fraud detection with imbalanced data
- `clv_churn/` – customer lifetime value or churn prediction
- `ml_platform_eval/` – evaluation + registry tooling for ML workflows
