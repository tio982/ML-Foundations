# ML Foundations Portfolio

This repository is the home base for a 6‑month, project‑driven roadmap to build
hireable, production‑style machine learning work in fintech. It is organized to
support multiple projects, each built with clear business value, reproducible
pipelines, and deployable artifacts.

## Goals
- Build 3–4 end‑to‑end ML projects that demonstrate ML engineering, data science,
  and ML platform skills.
- Tie every project to business metrics (cost, risk reduction, ROI).
- Keep projects reproducible with consistent structure and documentation.

## Repository Structure
- `projects/` – finished or in‑progress projects (one folder per project).
- `templates/project_template/` – the standard layout to copy when starting a
  new project.

## How We’ll Use This Repo
1. Start each new project by copying the template into `projects/<project_name>`.
2. Build the project incrementally, documenting decisions and results.
3. Maintain clear, business‑first READMEs for each project.

If you’re following along step‑by‑step, we will keep this repo updated at every
milestone so you can see exactly how a project grows from scratch.
